<!-- mouse- cursor-movement make shadow follow me around -->
<!-- this can be done on a phone where it's been tapped into the accelerometer -->
<!-- depending on how far a phone is tipping, the shadow will also follow -->
<!-- when I'm dealing with events, I can use offsetX and offsetY to get the position of where my cursor is -->
<!-- if I have nested elements, I will need to do a little math -->
