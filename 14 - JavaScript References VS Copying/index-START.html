    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age1 = age;
    // console.log(age, age1); // 100, 100
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age1); // 200, 100

    // let name = 'wes';
    // let name1 = name;
    // console.log(name, name1);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name1);

    // the values of the original variable go into the new variable
    // if I change the value of the original variable, the new variable won't be updated

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // same array twice

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // team's element at index 3 has changed

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // player's element at index 3 has also changed!

    // now here is the problem!
    // because I updated team... team is a reference to the original array, players (not a copy?)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // IF I UPDATE AN ARRAY, IT WILL ALWAYS REFERENCE BACK!!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice()
    // .slice(arg1, arg2) arg1 is the index to start at, and arg2 is the index to stop at?
    // original array will be untouched
    // when .slice is passed nothing, a copy of the array is made
    team1[3] = 'Kai';
    console.log(team1, players); // team1 has Kai in the array, but players is unchanged!

    // or create a new blank array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team2, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // spread will take every item out of my iterable and put it into the new container array
    // (spread can be used to spread into a function)
    const team3 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team3[3] = 'Stef';
    console.log(team3, players);

    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    team4[3] = 'Amy';
    console.log(team4, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;

    // this makes a reference instead

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // pass the function the object I want to copy all the properties from which is person
    // and then fold in my new properties, overwrite the ones I want to overwrite
    const captain1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});
    console.log(captain1, person);
    // I took a blank object (arg1), folded in all the properties and values from the original object (arg2).
    // and fold in new properties (arg3)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain2 = {...person};
    // this is similar to how react works; spreading into an object here

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // REACT is a popular open-source JS library for building user interfaces; it based on the concept of reusable components
    // Lodash is a popular JS library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks
    // Lodash is a collection of functions designed to work well with functional programming patterns and provide an
    // alternative to the built-in JS methods

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    // I can pass JSON.stringify an object, and the object is converted to a string
    // then I JSON.parse it to turn the string back into an object, 
    // and then I get a full copy of it
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); 

    // if I try to update properties two levels deeper, twitter or facebook, the original object will be changed!
    // to do a clone, I need a function called cloneDeep to clone every level to as deep as a level I would like
