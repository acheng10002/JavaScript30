const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

canvas.width = window.innerWidth;

// need to do base settings for stroke style, line cap, line join
// stroke style is color
ctx.strokeStyle = '#BADA55';

// drawing only happens when my cursor is down
// when I click down, isDrawing will be true
// when I click up, my cursor is up, isDrawing will be false

// this flag is common in JS, and I want to test if it's true or not

// below means it is building up

// draw function is called whenever I move my mouse on top of the canvas
// I only want draw to run when the user has clicked down
// when I move the mouse, use the event information to draw onto canvas context
function draw(e) {
  if (!isDrawing) return; // stop the function from running when they are not moused down
  console.log(e); // this runs when the user's is moused down
  // above is the click and drag functionality

  // need to start with an x and a y

  // go to

  // increment the hue

  // or is lineWidth is less than 1, also go in reverse direction

  // this puts me where I want to go instead of start at (0,0)
  [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY]
});

// when I move my mouse on the canvas, e will be console logged
// I can see in the mouseEvent, info about the event firing
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => isDrawing = false);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', () => isDrawing = false);

// HSL is the rainbow, but I can programmatically select pieces of the rainbow
// hue: goes from red to red; saturation: brightness; lightness: how black or white
// for every 360 draws, I can pick an increment of color and then
